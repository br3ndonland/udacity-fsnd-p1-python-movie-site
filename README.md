## intro

Film noir is one of my favorite genres. I decided to include two classic noir films, two neo noir films (in the film noir style, set in the noir era, but made more recently), and two future noir films (in the film noir style, set in the future). 

| Movies |||
|-------|------|-----|
| *Classic Noir* | Double Indemnity, 1944 | Out of the Past, 1947 |
| *Neo Noir* | Chinatown, 1974 | Body Heat, 1981|
| *Future Noir* | Blade Runner, 1982 | The Terminator, 1984 |


## instructions

Required files

1. *media.py* contains the class definition used to provide movie information.
2. *fresh_tomatoes_noir.py* calls a Bootstrap 3 template and contains HTML, CSS, and Python code to build the site
3. *noir.py* imports the above two files, provides movie information, and calls the `open_movies_page` function to build and open the site.

**Run *noir.py* in a Python 3 IDE, with all three above files in the same directory, to build the site.**
