## description

Server-side code written in Python to store a list of my favorite movies, including artwork and trailers, then serve the data to a local webpage with HTML and CSS.


## noir

Film noir is one of my favorite genres. I decided to include two classic noir films, two neo noir films (in the film noir style, set in the noir era, but made more recently), and two future noir films (containing elements of film noir, but set in the future). 

| Noir era | Movie 1 | Date | Movie 2 | Date |
|:-------|:------|:------|:------|:------|
| *Classic Noir* | Double Indemnity | 1944 | Out of the Past | 1947 |
| *Neo Noir* | Chinatown | 1974 | Body Heat | 1981|
| *Future Noir* | Blade Runner | 1982 | The Terminator | 1984 |


## instructions

Required files

1. *media.py* contains the class definition used to provide movie information.
2. *fresh_tomatoes_noir.py* calls a Bootstrap 3 template and contains HTML, CSS, and Python code to build the site
3. *noir.py* imports the above two files, provides movie information, and calls the `open_movies_page` function to build and open the site.

**Run *noir.py* in a Python 3 IDE, with all three above files in the same directory, to build the site.**
